# PlantUML

This repo is a collection of diagrams rendered by PlantUML. These diagrams are illustrated in text files. 
For full syntax of the text files, please refer to [PlantUML Language Reference Guide](http://translate.plantuml.com/zh).

## How to View PlantUML files

Both the PlantUML files and their diagrams are here. Generally you can see the effect of these diagrams by directly opening them, but if you don't like their effect, you can edit their PlantUML files by yourself.

After the PlantUML files are edited, you need to open them in Chrome browser with [PlantUML Viewer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/plantuml-viewer/legbfeljfbjgfifnkmpoajgpgejojooj) plugin.
This plugin should be enabled to access file address.
